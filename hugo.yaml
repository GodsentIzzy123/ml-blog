    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/firstimage.jpg"
    content: |-
               I am a PhD student at Western Michigan University, specializing in statistics. With a strong foundation in data science and machine learning, I am passionate about leveraging statistical methodologies and cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. My academic background, combined with hands-on industry experience, positions me at the intersection of research and practical application.
               As a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer, I am proficient in Python, SQL, and R. My expertise includes developing end-to-end machine learning pipelines, where I have successfully utilized tools like Git, MLflow, and Data Version Control (DVC) to ensure efficient collaboration, model tracking, and reproducibility. These projects have honed my skills in data preprocessing, model deployment, and performance optimization.
               Beyond my technical skills, I am deeply motivated to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and actionable outcomes. Whether through designing scalable algorithms or implementing robust data pipelines, my goal is to contribute to impactful projects that drive innovation.

               Currently, I am seeking opportunities for a job or internship where I can further apply my skills, collaborate with dynamic teams, and continue to grow as a data science professional. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to integrate advanced statistical methods with machine learning to deliver meaningful solutions.
